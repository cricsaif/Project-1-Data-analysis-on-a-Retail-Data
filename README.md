Most sales were recorded in quarter 4 as it produced double the sales compared to other quarters.

#### MSRP

MSRP means manufacturer's suggested retail price. For example, the MSRP price for a product may be £50 but a company may sell it for £45. Our total PRICEEACH was 84159.65 and MSRP was 101539. The difference shows that by not reccomending the manufacturer's price the company has lost 17379 and that's only in USA.
